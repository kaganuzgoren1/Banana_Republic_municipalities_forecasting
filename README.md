# Banana_Republic_municipalities_forecasting
TASK: Forecasting bus demand in Banana Republic municipalities.

The central urban planning commitee of Banana Republic asked you to help them with the forecast of bus demands of municipalities. And they provide a nice dataset to support you (https://pi.works/3w8IJbV). 

For the project, 3 different forecasting methods are used. 1st is the Sckit-learn linear regression, 2nd is the XGBoost, and the 3rd is the CNN with Keras. The mean absolute error for each model is written after their implementation for forecasting.
